Project Name: 99 Bottles
Objective:
As part of this project, you will have to devise a program that prints out every line to the folk song 99 bottles of beer on the wall. The user will have to use a built-in function instead. Besides the phrase “take one down,” you may not type in any numbers or names of numbers directly into your song lyrics. Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word “bottles” becomes singular.
Functions Used:
Here, we have created one function named counter_99, used for loop and if-else loop inside it to specify condition for no bottle, one bottle and two bottles.
